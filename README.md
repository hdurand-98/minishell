# minishell

A very hard duo project where we recreate a small but quite complete shell (you heard me right). Aside from the huge amount of parsing that this project requires, it covers a wide range of very interesting subjects : processes and how to fork them, making them communicate with pipes, signals, redirections and a lot more. This project is truely a deep dive into how computers work !

# How to use
